# CS445: Software Engineering Guidelines

*A portion of your team's final project will be graded against these guidelines and specifications*
  
1. Software breaks at the interfaces
    * If you don't do a system architectural design with well-defined interfaces, integration will be a big mess.You must have some external system architecural design that is kept up to date with your current architecture.

2. Good software is in your head, not the computer
      * Design, Design, Design, then design some more. You should spend at least as much time designing your code, before you write a single line, as you will spend coding.

3. Try to make your development environment as close to your production environment as possible (without giving away secrets) 
     * Designing the running environment is as important as  designing project itself. Many projects require as much time setting up the running environment as they do for development.

4. "What takes 1 Dev one month to complete, will will take 2 devs two months, but will be better"
     * The more people on a project the longer it takes. Adding team members that are new to a project are less productive (1/3 to 2/3 less), so new devs add at minimum 1/3 more time to the timeline.

5. Productivity varies greatly depending knowledge of the tools, methods, and notations used
      * Invest time in Documentation. Don't write from scratch something that can be easily accomplished with a call to a library. 

6. Fluctuating and conflicting requirements is a major phenomenon that greatly reduces software productivity and quality  
      * Each time a component or requirements changes, the amount of work to integrate the change is proportional to how much of the project has already been completed.
